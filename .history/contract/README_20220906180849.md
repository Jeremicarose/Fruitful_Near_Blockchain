## Inspiration 💡

Most of the time, Farmers sells there product at a throwing price because of  
For that they will lose a lot of money feeling discourage and this will force them to venture to any othe bussiness.
As a result, there is the need for a secure and efficient system to help farmers and buyers link without any middlemen. 

## ❓ What it does 💡
Fruitfull is a decentralized and secure farming marketplace system. Its built on the Near blockchain and securely stores all farm product transaction records.

The avocado products and transaction are securely stored in the ledger and can be accessed by the farmer or the buyer.

First, on the app, either the farmer or the buy will connect their solana wallet to the Zircon app.

The wallet maybe either Phantom or Solflare.

If the its the first time the user is connecting their wallet, the user will be prompted to create add additional details about the hospital.

When the administrator of Hospital A requests the medical records of a patient, the system will send the request to Hospital B.

When the administrator of Hospital B logs on the app, he/she will view the request and respond to it either using a message or sending the medical records or even both.

When the administrator of Hospital A logs on the app, he/she will view the request and see the messages and medical records sent by the other hospital.

## ⚙ How it was built
- React, Next JS and Chakra UI for the frontend
- Phantom, Solflare, Solana Web3 for the Blockchain and smart contracts
- Anchor for building the smart contracts in Rust programming language
- IPFS for storing the medical records.
- Solana blockchain for the ledger

## 🚧 Challenges 🚧
- Implementing the smart contracts in Rust programming language was a challenge.
- Ran into bugs while building the smart contracts especially while building the  smart contract.


## 🚀 Extended Features 🚀
- Notifications for the medical team administrator to know when the request is made and when the response is received by use email or SMS.


near-blank-project Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.
