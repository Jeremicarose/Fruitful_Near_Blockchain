## Inspiration üí°

Most of the time, Farmers sells there product at a throwing price because of  
For that they will lose a lot of money feeling discourage and this will force them to venture to any othe bussiness.
As a result, there is the need for a secure and efficient system to help farmers and buyers link without any middlemen. 

## ‚ùì What it does üí°
Fruitfull is a decentralized and secure farming marketplace system. Its built on the Near blockchain and securely stores all farm product transaction records.

The avocado products and transaction are securely stored in the ledger and can be accessed by the farmer or the buyer.

First, on the app, either the farmer or the buy will connect their near wallet to the fruitfull app.

If this is the farmer he or she is require to post her product unlike the buyer who can not post. On the other hand the buyer can purchase any ovacados.

## ‚öô How it was built
- React for the frontend
- Near, Rust  Web3 for the Blockchain and smart contracts
- Near for building the smart contracts in Rust programming language
- Near blockchain for the ledger

## üöß Challenges üöß
- Implementing the smart contracts in Rust programming language was a challenge.
- Ran into bugs while building the smart contracts especially while building the  smart contract.





near-blank-project Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.
