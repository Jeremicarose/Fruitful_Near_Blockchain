## Inspiration üí°

Most of the time, Farmers sells there product at a throwing price because of  
For that they will lose a lot of money feeling discourage and this will force them to venture to any othe bussiness.
As a result, there is the need for a secure and efficient system to help farmers and buyers link without any middlemen. 

## ‚ùì What it does üí°
Fruitfull is a decentralized and secure farming marketplace system. Its built on the Near blockchain and securely stores all farm product transaction records.

The avocado products and transaction are securely stored in the ledger and can be accessed by the farmer or the buyer.

First, on the app, either the farmer or the buy will connect their near wallet to the fruitfull app.

If this is the farmer he or she is require to post her product unlike the buyer who can not post. On the other hand the buyer can purchase any ovacados.

## ‚öô How it was built
- React for the frontend
- Near, Rust  Web3 for the Blockchain and smart contracts
- Near for building the smart contracts in Rust programming language
- Near blockchain for the ledger

## üöß Challenges üöß
- Implementing the smart contracts in Rust programming language was a challenge.
- Ran into bugs while building the smart contracts especially while building the  smart contract.





near-blank-project Smart Contract
==================

A [smart contract] written in [Rust] for an app initialized with [create-near-app]


Quick Start
===========

Before you compile this code, you will need to install Rust with [correct target]


Exploring The Code
==================

1. The main smart contract code lives in `src/lib.rs`.
2. Tests: You can run smart contract tests with the `./test` script. This runs
   standard Rust tests using [cargo] with a `--nocapture` flag so that you
   can see any debug info you print to the console.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
